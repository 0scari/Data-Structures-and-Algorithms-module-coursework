1. The factorial for a non-negative integer n, n!, is defined as: 0! = 1 n! = n * (n-1)! (n > 0). The input to
your program consists of several lines, each containing two non-negative integers, n and m, both less
than 2^31. For each input line, output a line stating whether or not m divides n!.

Example input:
    6 9
    6 27
    20 10000
    20 100000
Example output:
    9 divides 6!
    27 does not divide 6!
    10000 divides 20!
    100000 doe not divide 20!


2. A lorry can carry at most n kilograms. The name of the materials, the amount of material in kilograms
and the material price per kilo are known. Compute a load composition in such a way that the value
(price) of the load is maximum.

Input:
 N = 10
 Copper 7kg 65
 Plastic 15 kg 50
 Gold 4kg 100

Output:
 Load composition value = 790
 4 kg of gold and 6 kg of copper
