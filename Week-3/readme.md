## Week 3 Advanced

Consider having n cubes, each being characterized by their edge length and their colour. Use the cubes
to build a tower of maximum height, under the following conditions:
*  Any two neighbouring cubes must be of different colours.
* The edge length of a cube is lower than the edge length of the cube placed below it.

Example input: n = 3
* cube1: colour red, edge length 5
* cube2: colour red, edge length 6
* cube3: colour blue, edge length 5

Example output: 16 (maximum tower height â€“ corresponding to cube2, cube3 and cube1 in this order)
