## Week 6 Advanced

Implement a system that maintains information for school classes. For each of the students in a class
the following information is kept: a unique code, student name, birth date, home address, id of class
he is currently in, date of enrolment, status (undergrad, graduate). For keeping track of the students, a
computer program based on a binary search tree data structure is used. Write a program that
implements the following operations:

• Find a student by his/hers unique code, and support updating of the student info if found.

• List students by class in lexicographic order of their names.

• List all students in lexicographic order of their names.

• List all graduated students.

• List all undergrads by their class in lexicographic order of their names.

• Delete a student given by its code.

• Delete all graduates.
